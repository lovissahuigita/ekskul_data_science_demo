# Week 5 Demo

This repository contains some jupyter demos for you to get started. It includes:
- data import
- data clean up
- data processing

The demo code presented in the lecture can be found in:
> week5demo.ipynb

You can run this python notebook by opening binder and running jupyter from there.
1. Open [Binder](https://gke.mybinder.org/)
2. Fill in `GitHub repository name or URL`: `https://github.com/lovissahuigita/ekskul_data_science_demo.git`
4. Hit `Launch`! and wait until your notebook is launched.
5. Click on `week5`, then click on `week5demo.ipynb` file to see the demo file.

6. When you are in the jupyter file, click on the `Jupyter` logo on the top left
![Home Page](/img/img2.png "Home Page")
7. From the home page, you can see the directory for the project
8. You can add move .csv files by clicking on `upload`. Please note that we are using a remote server. There will be a size limit on the file you can add to the server. If you want more freedom on the file size, here are some instructions [to host jupyter](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) locally.

## Sample Datasets
In the links below are sites where you can download datasets for you to play around:
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/fun-beginner-friendly-datasets)
- [Historical US Stock Prices](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/historical.asp)
- [UCI Datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)

Feel free to grab any data from these places and start asking questions!
## When you're working with pandas...
You may not know all the methods you need. But, google google goole! (or whatever search engine you use...)

Sample google search texts maybe:
> pandas find count on a column from another column

`https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39607540/count-the-number-of-occurrence-of-values-based-on-another-column`

> pandas divide a column by its mean

`https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40940423/divide-column-in-pandas-dataframe-by-sum-of-column`

> pandas create column based on a condition

`https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21702342/creating-a-new-column-based-on-if-elif-else-condition`

If you can't tell already... I use stack overflow quite often! They're your friend!

Don't feel like you need to know ALL pandas functions... There are too many. No need to memorize them, they are all documented in this beautiful thing called the internet. My suggestions would be for you to just start from the data, and then figure out the functions you need to answer the questions you have from your data. The more you practice, the more you'll be familiarized with the common functions, or sometime the rare library functions.

Happy hacking people!

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions :)
